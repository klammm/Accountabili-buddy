Next steps:
------------
1. If you have separate index.ios.js and index.android.js files, you'll need to create a main.js file that contains `require('./index');`. Also set `"main": "main.js"` in package.json.
2. Find your AppRegistry.registerComponent('YourApplicationName', () => YourRootComponent) call and replace it with Expo.registerRootComponent(YourRootComponent) (you will need to import Expo from 'expo').
3. Upload your app icon somewhere on the web and add it the newly created exp.json file, in the iconUrl and loading.iconUrl fields.
4. Delete your 'android' and 'ios' directories if you have them -- you no longer need to compile any native code to run your app.
5. We didn't detect any known incompatible packages, but if you have any with native dependencies installed, you will need to remove them from your project.
6. Open your app in XDE and run it, fix bugs as they arise.
